# Turning Data Into Documents Across All Modules

The dbocl platform includes comprehensive reporting and export capabilities throughout all modules. Each section of the platform—People, Schedule, Files, Tasks, and Travel—offers specialized export options designed to create professional documents and share information effectively with different audiences.

## Schedule Reports

The Schedule page's most prominent reporting feature is accessed through the Mail/Envelope icon in the toolbar. This generates sendable and printable itineraries in PDF format, ideal for distribution to staff, vendors, and clients.

## Cross-Platform Export Features

### Common Export Capabilities

All modules share certain export principles and capabilities:

- **Filter Respect**: Exports always respect the filters currently applied on each page, allowing for targeted document generation.
- **Privacy Awareness**: The system automatically respects privacy settings and user permissions when generating exports, ensuring sensitive information doesn't appear in unauthorized reports.
- **Format Flexibility**: Most modules offer both CSV (for data manipulation) and PDF (for presentation) export options.
- **Customizable Content**: Choose what fields and information levels to include based on the intended audience and purpose.

## Best Practices for Effective Reporting

### Content Strategy

- **Audience-Appropriate Information**: Generate different reports for different stakeholders—detailed technical information for operations teams, high-level summaries for executives, simplified versions for external participants.
- **Filter Before Export**: Use the platform's filtering capabilities to create focused reports rather than overwhelming recipients with unnecessary information.
- **Privacy Considerations**: Always review export settings to ensure sensitive information is appropriately protected based on the intended audience.

### Template and Consistency

- **Save Configurations**: Use preset templates where available to maintain consistency across similar reports and future events.
- **Regular Updates**: For events with changing information, establish clear protocols for when to regenerate and redistribute reports.
- **Version Control**: When distributing static reports, include generation dates and version information to prevent confusion about current versus outdated information.

### Distribution Methods

- **Choose Appropriate Formats**: Use PDFs for formal distribution and presentation, CSV for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Leverage Integration**: Take advantage of direct email distribution and shareable link options where available.
- **Maintain Security**: Use private markings and access controls for internal documents while creating appropriately public versions for external distribution.

The reporting and export system across dbocl modules transforms your event management data into professional, actionable documents. By leveraging the filtering, customization, and format options available in each module, you can ensure that every stakeholder receives exactly the information they need in the format that serves them best.
