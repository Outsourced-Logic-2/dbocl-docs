<Accordion title="Managing People and Teams">
  ## What tabs are available on a person's profile?
  Each person's profile has multiple tabs:
  - **Relations**: Shows linked people like manager, agent, spouse, with hierarchical or lateral relationships and custom relation types
  - **Preferences**: Travel preferences, dietary restrictions, lodging preferences, accessibility needs, and custom fields
  - **Notes**: Timeline-style notes system with timestamp, author, optional tags, file attachments, and visibility settings
  - **Visibility Settings**: Defining whether the person is event-specific or shared across organization, with permission level settings

  - Confirmed (accepted and locked in)
  - Passed (considered, but not accepted)
  - Canceled (was confirmed but then canceled)

  ## How does the tagging system work for people?
  Tags allow for deep categorization and filtering. They can be freeform or pre-defined, are color-coded, and used for filtering on the main page and within exports. Example tags include "Performer," "Security," "Keynote," and "Allergy."

  ## How can I import or export people data?
  You can bulk import people with a CSV template that includes matching fields like name, department, and role. For export, you can generate PDFs or CSVs with filters applied, options to include preferences, notes, and tasks, and the ability to anonymize sensitive data.
